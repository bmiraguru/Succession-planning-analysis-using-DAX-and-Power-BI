**Succession Planning Insights: A Balancing Act of Diversity, Engagement, and Performance**

We've identified 1,500 successors within our organization, with 718 of them being high-potential employees (HiPos). Of these, 331 come from diverse backgrounds.

Looking at the data, there's a clear trend: from 2018 to 2022, employee engagement steadily increased, hitting its highest point in 2022 with a score of 5.23. 
However, 2023 saw a slight dip to 4.95, suggesting that we may need to refocus on engagement initiatives. 
In 2018, when engagement was at its lowest (4.85), we saw the highest performance ratings, particularly among diverse employees (3.11 compared to 2.95 for non-diverse). 
Yet, despite their strong performance, diverse groups showed lower engagement (4.94) and job satisfaction (2.43) compared to their non-diverse counterparts.

Interestingly, male successors had slightly higher engagement and performance scores than female successors, but female successors had a higher job satisfaction score. 
The senior age group (55-64) reported the highest levels of both job satisfaction and performance, reflecting their experience and contribution.

Overall, while we’ve made strides in identifying diverse HiPos and improving engagement over time, there’s still a gap in ensuring all employees, particularly those from diverse groups, feel both engaged and satisfied. 
Bridging this gap will be key to fostering a more inclusive and high-performing leadership pipeline.

**Recommendations:**

**Support Diverse Talent:** Improve engagement and job satisfaction for diverse HiPos through mentorship, development programs, and recognition initiatives.

**Balance Engagement and Performance:** Focus on programs that maintain high performance while boosting employee engagement across all groups.

**Sustain Senior Leadership Engagement: **Leverage the high satisfaction and performance of senior employees (55-64) by involving them in mentoring or leadership roles.

**Monitor and Adjust Engagement Strategies: **Address the engagement dip in 2023 by refining current initiatives and ensuring ongoing improvement.

These actions can strengthen succession planning and improve long-term performance across the board.
