Our succession planning efforts have identified 1,500 potential successors, with 718 high-potential employees (HiPos), of which 331 come from diverse backgrounds. The overall performance of our diverse talent is strong, with an average performance rating of 3.11 compared to 2.95 for non-diverse employees. However, diverse groups show slightly lower engagement (4.94 vs. 5.11) and job satisfaction (2.43 vs. 2.47) than their non-diverse peers.

In terms of gender, male and female successors exhibit similar engagement scores (5.03 vs. 5.00), with female successors reporting slightly higher job satisfaction (2.50 vs. 2.47) but lower performance ratings (2.96 vs. 3.04).

When looking at trends over time, employee engagement has steadily increased from 4.85 in 2018 to a peak of 5.23 in 2022, though there was a dip in 2023 to 4.95.

Notably, senior employees (ages 55-64) report the highest levels of both job satisfaction and performance, underscoring their value in leadership roles. Despite their strong performance, there remains a gap in representation, as non-diverse HiPos still outnumber their diverse counterparts.


1. Enhance Engagement and Job Satisfaction for Diverse Employees
Targeted Development Programs: Implement leadership development and mentorship programs specifically tailored for diverse groups to address lower engagement (4.94) and job satisfaction (2.43) compared to non-diverse employees.
Inclusive Culture Initiatives: Foster an inclusive workplace culture where diverse employees feel valued and supported. This can include diversity training for leadership teams and promoting an environment where diverse voices are heard and represented.
2. Increase Representation of Diverse HiPos
Review Talent Identification Processes: Reassess the criteria and processes used to identify HiPos to ensure diverse employees are equally considered and that unconscious biases are minimized. This can help bridge the gap between diverse HiPos (331) and their non-diverse counterparts.
Promote Diverse Leadership: Encourage visibility and role modeling by diverse leaders within the organization. By promoting successful diverse leaders, you can inspire and motivate others to reach leadership positions.
3. Maintain and Enhance Engagement Momentum
Monitor Engagement Trends Closely: While engagement has generally improved from 2018 to 2022, the dip in 2023 to 4.95 is concerning. Conduct pulse surveys to identify the causes behind this drop and take corrective action through initiatives like leadership development, flexible work options, and  employee recognition programs.
Engage Senior Leaders as Mentors: Leverage the high engagement and satisfaction of senior employees (ages 55-64) by involving them in mentorship programs. This will help pass on their knowledge and experience to younger employees.
4. Focus on Gender Parity in Leadership Development
Bridge Performance Gaps: While female successors have slightly higher job satisfaction (2.50) compared to males, they lag in performance ratings (2.96 vs. 3.04). Create targeted performance improvement programs that focus on leadership skills, visibility, and opportunities for female employees to close this gap.
Equitable Leadership Training: Ensure that both male and female successors have equal access to leadership development resources, such as stretch assignments, sponsorship, and coaching.
5. Utilize Senior Employees as Knowledge Leaders
Retain Senior Talent: Senior employees (ages 55-64) have the highest job satisfaction and performance. Retain them through phased retirement programs and tap into their expertise as coaches for emerging leaders.
6. Promote Data-Driven Decision Making in Succession Planning
Continuous Monitoring of Key Metrics: Regularly track performance, engagement, and job satisfaction metrics across different demographics to ensure data-driven decisions in succession planning.
Sharing these insights with leaders across the organization can raise awareness about the importance of diversity, engagement, and performance in leadership development.
